              database searches may now become a routine procedure for
              molecular biologists. The method efficiently identifies regions

              replacability matrix. This matrix increases sensitivity by giving
              high scores to those amino acid replacements which occur
              frequently in evolution. The algorithm has been implemented in a
              computer program designed to search protein databases very
              rapidly. For example, comparison of a 200-amino-acid sequence to
              the 500,000 residues in the National Biomedical Research

  abstract = "Using non-conventional markers, DNA metabarcoding allows
              biodiversity assessment from complex substrates. In this article,
              we present ecoPrimers, a software for identifying new barcode
              markers and their associated PCR primers. ecoPrimers scans whole
              genomes to find such markers without a priori knowledge.
              ecoPrimers optimizes two quality indices measuring taxonomical
              range and discrimination to select the most efficient markers
              from a set of reference sequences, according to specific
              experimental constraints such as marker length or specifically
              targeted taxa. The key step of the algorithm is the
              identification of conserved regions among reference sequences for
              anchoring primers. We propose an efficient algorithm based on
              data mining, that allows the analysis of huge sets of sequences.
              We evaluate the efficiency of ecoPrimers by running it on three
              different sequence sets: mitochondrial, chloroplast and bacterial
              genomes. Identified barcode markers correspond either to barcode
              regions already in use for plants or animals, or to new potential
              barcodes. Results from empirical experiments carried out on a
              promising new barcode for analyzing vertebrate diversity fully
              agree with expectations based on bioinformatics analysis. These
              tests demonstrate the efficiency of ecoPrimers for inferring new
              barcodes fitting with diverse experimental contexts. ecoPrimers

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Ribosomal 16S DNA sequences are an essential tool for
              identifying and classifying microbes. High-throughput DNA
              sequencing now makes it economically possible to produce very
              large datasets of 16S rDNA sequences in short time periods,
              necessitating new computer tools for analyses. Here we describe
              FastGroup, a Java program designed to dereplicate libraries of
              16S rDNA sequences. By dereplication we mean to: 1) compare all
              the sequences in a data set to each other, 2) group similar
              sequences together, and 3) output a representative sequence from
              each group. In this way, duplicate sequences are removed from a
              library. RESULTS: FastGroup was tested using a library of
              single-pass, bacterial 16S rDNA sequences cloned from
              coral-associated bacteria. We found that the optimal strategy for
              dereplicating these sequences was to: 1) trim ambiguous bases
              from the 5' end of the sequences and all sequence 3' of the
              conserved Bact517 site, 2) match the sequences from the 3' end,
              and 3) group sequences > or =97\% identical to each other.
              CONCLUSIONS: The FastGroup program simplifies the dereplication
              of 16S rDNA sequence libraries and prepares the raw sequences for
              subsequent analyses.",

              high-throughput and simultaneous taxa identification based on a

              diversity detected from boreal soil was highly consistent with

              conventional above-ground surveys. Second, we assessed DNA
              persistence using samples from formerly cultivated soils in

               dry phases and periodic inundation defines their ecological
               character. Climate change, river regulation and the construction
               of levees have substantially altered natural flooding and drying
               regimes worldwide with uncertain effects on key biotic groups.
               In southern Australia, we hypothesized that soil eukaryotic
               communities in climate change affected areas of a semi-arid
               floodplain would transition towards comprising mainly dry-soil
               specialist species with increasing drought severity. Here, we
               used 18S rRNA amplicon pyrosequencing to measure the eukaryote
               community composition in soils that had been depleted of water
               to varying degrees to confirm that reproducible transitional
               changes occur in eukaryotic biodiversity on this floodplain.
               Interflood community structures (3 years post-flood) were
               dominated by persistent rather than either aquatic or
               dry-specialist organisms. Only 2\% of taxa were unique to dry
               locations by 8 years post-flood, and 10\% were restricted to wet
               locations (inundated a year to 2 weeks post-flood). Almost half
               (48\%) of the total soil biota were detected in both these
               environments. The discovery of a large suite of organisms able
               to survive nearly a decade of drought, and up to a year
               submerged supports the concept of inherent resilience of
               Australian semi-arid floodplain soil communities under
               increasing pressure from climatic induced changes in water

              practical and taxonomic expertise, which is rapidly declining.
              Here, we show that a diversity of rare and threatened freshwater

              after removal of animals, indicating that DNA traces are near
              contemporary with presence of the species. We further demonstrate
              that entire faunas of amphibians and fish can be detected by

               DNA fragments shorter than 100-150 bp remain in a much higher
               proportion in degraded DNA samples and can be recovered from
               faeces. As a consequence, by using universal primers that
               amplify a very short but informative DNA fragment, it is
               possible to reliably identify the plant taxon that has been
               eaten. According to our experience and using this identification
               system, about 50\% of the taxa can be identified to species
               using the trnL approach, that is, using the P6 loop of the

               large-scale studies on diet, but also by enhancing studies on

  abstract  = "Large herbivores are keystone species in many forest areas, as
               they shape the structure, species diversity and functioning of
               those ecosystems. The European bison Bison bonasus has been
               successfully restored after extinction in the wild at the
               beginning of 20th century. As free-ranging populations of the
               species were re-established mainly in forest habitats, knowledge
               of the impact by the largest European terrestrial mammal on tree
               stands is essential. This helps to make management and
               conservation decisions for viable population maintenance of the
               species in the wild. Using a novel DNA-based method of herbivore
               diet analysis, the trnL approach (DNA-barcoding), we
               investigated the influence of different foraging conditions
               (access to supplementary fodder) on bison diet in winter and its
               potential impact on woody species. Faecal samples were collected
               from different bison treatment groups: (1) intensively fed; (2)
               less intensively fed; (3) non-fed utilising forest habitats; and
               (4) non-fed utilising agricultural areas surrounding the Forest.
               These were analysed to estimate the proportion of different
               plant groups consumed by bison. Bison groups differed
               significantly in their diet. The amount of woody materials
               (trees and shrubs) consumed by bison increased with decreasing
               access to supplementary fodder, ranging from 16\% in intensively
               fed bison to 65\% in non-fed bison utilising forest habitats.
               Inversely, the amount of herbs, grasses and sedges decreased
               from 82\% in intensively fed bison to 32\% in non fed bison
               utilising forest habitats. The species of trees mainly browsed
               by bison, Carpinus/Corylus, Betula sp. and Salix sp., were of
               lower economic importance for forest management. The impact of
               bison on tree species needs further investigation, however, we
               can predict that browsing by bison, mainly on Carpinus/Corylus,
               makes an insignificant impact on forestry due to the high and
               increasing representation of this species in the forest
               understory. Supplementary feeding has several negative effects
               on bison ecology and health, therefore reduced and distributed
               supplementary feeding should be applied as the management
               practice in the Bia{\l}owie{\.z}a Forest.",

  abstract = "DNA-based techniques have proven useful for defining trophic
              links in a variety of ecosystems and recently developed
              sequencing technologies provide new opportunities for dietary
              studies. We investigated the diet of Australian fur seals
              (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) by pyrosequencing prey DNA
              from faeces collected at three breeding colonies across the
              seals' range. DNA from 270 faecal samples was amplified with four
              polymerase chain reaction primer sets and a blocking primer was
              used to limit amplification of fur seal DNA. Pooled amplicons
              from each colony were sequenced using the Roche GS-FLX platform,
              generating > 20,000 sequences. Software was developed to sort and
              group similar sequences. A total of 54 bony fish, 4 cartilaginous
              fish and 4 cephalopods were identified based on the most
              taxonomically informative amplicons sequenced (mitochondrial
              16S). The prevalence of sequences from redbait (Emmelichthys
              nitidus) and jack mackerel (Trachurus declivis) confirm the
              importance of these species in the seals' diet. A third fish
              species, blue mackerel (Scomber australasicus), may be a more
              important prey species than previously recognised. There were
              major differences in the proportions of prey DNA recovered in
              faeces from different colonies, probably reflecting differences
              in prey availability. Parallel hard-part analysis identified
              largely the same main prey species as did the DNA-based
              technique, but with lower species diversity and no remains from
              cartilaginous prey. The pyrosequencing approach presented
              significantly expands the capabilities of DNA-based methods of
              dietary analysis and is suitable for large-scale diet
              investigations on a broad range of animals.",
