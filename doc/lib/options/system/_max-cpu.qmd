**\--max-cpu**

: OBITools V4 are able to run in parallel on all the CPU cores available on the computer. It is sometime required to limit the computation to a smaller number of cores. That option specify the maximum number of cores that the OBITools command can use. This behaviour can also be set up using the `OBIMAXCPU` environment variable.
